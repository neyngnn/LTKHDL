## Introduction

- This is the Final Project of class **Programming for Data Science - 21_21** (2023).

- Our project aims to research human health. Data has been collected regarding the health status of the population in the United States in 2022. The research objective is to understand the physical health conditions of individuals within different age groups, genders, etc. Additionally, we aim to assess health-related diseases and potentially develop a model to diagnose health conditions based on common symptoms. Due to the large size of the data (approximately 20MB), our team will only extract health information data from one randomly selected state (California) for analysis following the data science process. 

- Data for the project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/data?select=2022), the data is completely free to access.
